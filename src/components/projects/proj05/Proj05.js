                    In this model, we explore both the practical applications of diffusion models, as well as some of their inner workings by implementing them on our own.
                    In part A, we use the pre-trained DeepFloyd diffusion model to generate a variety of images on our own. In part B, we actually implement our very own
                    diffusion model from scratch, and include both time-conditioning and class-conditioning to see how image generation improves.
