This is likely because the background remains largely static, and the robotic arm, which is the only moving object, occupies a small portion of the frame. As a result, the model struggles to learn the arm's motion from the action embeddings."

This suggests that, while the cascaded UNet does not improve action learning from the exterior camera angle, it does enhance the stability of the predictions.<br /><br />This observation motivated us to train and evaluate on wrist camera angles, where there is more motion and it is easier to assess the model's performance."
